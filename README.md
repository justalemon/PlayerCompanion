# PlayerCompanion

PlayerCompanion is a mod for Grand Theft Auto V that adds and extends some in game features:

* Inventory System that every other mod can enjoy (PlayerCompanion.Companion.Inventories)
  * Developers can implement their own Inventory Items, also enjoying this mod! (inherit PlayerCompanion.Item or PlayerCompanion.StackableItem)
* Money Storage for Addon Peds (PlayerCompanion.Companion.Wallet, useable by other mods)
* Weapon Storage for Addon Peds (change the weapons of an Addon Ped, and they will be restored the next time that you use it)

The main target of this mod is other developers that can use and extend the Inventory and Money system, either by creating new Inventory Items, adding a new Inventory Interface for the User and performing Monetary Transactions.

You can see some implementation examples in <a href="https://github.com/justalemon/GGOV">GGOV</a> (custom Inventory UI) and <a href="https://github.com/justalemon/DumpsterDiving">DumpsterDiving</a> (custom Items).
